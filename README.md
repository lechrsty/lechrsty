 <h2> :sparkles: About Me :sparkles: </h2>
 
<bio> I'm a Full Stack Software Developer with a passion for music and a commitment to social justice. Iâ€™m eager to quench my thirst for transforming the abstract into more concrete, tangible forms. I look forward to contributing to projects that align with my personal ethos and interests, where I can utilize my skillsets to create solutions that facilitate and cultivate a more equitable future for all. My maxim is to do everything with intention. It's inspiring to not only be in constant exploration of new technologies, but to realize their potential to drive social impact and the role I can create for myself in that story.
